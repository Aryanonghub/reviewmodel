# 🎬 Review Analysis System

A **Streamlit web app** for analyzing movie reviews and classifying them as **positive** or **negative** using a pre-trained **RNN model** built with TensorFlow and Keras on the IMDb dataset.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project allows users to input any movie review text and receive a real-time sentiment prediction.  
It uses a simple **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** trained on the IMDb movie review dataset.  
The web interface is built with **Streamlit** for a fast, clean, and easy user experience.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Input:** Users can input any movie review.
- **Sentiment Prediction:** Classifies the review as **Positive** or **Negative**.
- **Prediction Score:** Shows the model's confidence score for the prediction.
- **Real-time Analysis:** Quick response via a lightweight Streamlit interface.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Streamlit**
- **IMDb Dataset (Keras built-in)**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The app loads a pre-trained RNN model (`simple_rnn_imdb.h5`).
- User input is **preprocessed** by:
  - Tokenizing words based on IMDb's word index.
  - Padding the sequence to a fixed length (500).
- The processed text is passed to the model for **sentiment prediction**.
- Displays whether the review is **Positive** or **Negative** along with the **confidence score**.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/review-analysis-system.git
   cd review-analysis-system
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow streamlit
   ```

3. **Make sure you have the pre-trained model file:**
   - `simple_rnn_imdb.h5` should be present in the project folder.

4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open the app** in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

## 📢 Future Improvements

- Add live review scraping (e.g., from Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb).
- Improve preprocessing with punctuation removal and stopword filtering.
- Deploy online using platforms like Streamlit Cloud or AWS.
